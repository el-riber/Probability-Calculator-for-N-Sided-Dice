# ðŸŽ² Probability Calculator for N-Sided Dice

This Python program simulates rolling **M number of N-sided dice** over **K trials** and calculates the probability distribution of the outcomes. It also displays a histogram of the results using `matplotlib`.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Simulates dice rolls for any N-sided dice
- Accepts custom number of dice (M) and simulations (K)
- Calculates probability distribution of all possible sums
- Displays results in the console and as a bar chart
- Robust input validation
- Optional GUI (Tkinter) for extra credit (coming soon)

## ðŸ§ª Example Use Case

- **N = 6** â†’ 6-sided die
- **M = 2** â†’ rolling 2 dice
- **K = 1000** â†’ simulate 1000 rolls

Expected output is a probability table and histogram of possible sums from 2 to 12.
